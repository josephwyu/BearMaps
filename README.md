# BearMaps
A web application I built in my Data Structures course that will display a map of Berkeley and find the shortest path between two locations

# Features and Data Structures
- Uses KDTrees to find the closest location to where a User clicks
- Uses A* to find the shortest path between two locations
- TrieSet to implement the search and autocomplete function
